        So I wrote this in nov 2018, I wrote more than is here but it ended up deleted. I had a really cool key binding
        system working, I was real proud of it, but I didn't like the code it was with (this code). I have elaborated on
        the bindings stuff in another project I have yet to put on github. When I make the repo and push it, I'll link
        to it <a>here</a>. I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrEvoKI07Ww" target="_blank">
            this video</a> and got inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/LrEvoKI07Ww?t=453" target="_blank">this one</a>
        and was trying to make it myself when I got sidetracked by the controls idea. Anyways, this is abandoned, adios.
